# SnakeGame

// RULES OF THE GAME

In the game hitting the f key moves the snake forward one 
space. With each space it moves you gain 1 point. Hitting the
l key turns the head to the left and the r key to the right.
The snakes tail grows with each movment forward. The board
wraps around so you can go off the edge. You start off with
60 EU. Moving takes away 1 EU at a time. Eating an egg ,aka
the o, gives you 15 more EU. Eating a bug, aka the X, gives
you 25 more EU. If you run out of EU you die. Also if you
hit your own tail you die.
